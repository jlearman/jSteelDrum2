# jSteelDrum2
 C Steel Drum sampled instrument, sfz format, version 2

- Hand-made oil-drum steel drum.
- 27 notes sampled, C4 (middle C) to B5
- 5 velocity layers
- 3 or 4 samples per zone
- Stereo 16 bit, 44.1 KHz samples
- Unlooped
- 44 MB in FLAC format

## Comparison to version 1

- The lower octave was resampled to get more even dynamics.  The first time I sampled the instrument, I concentrated on using the same stike force for each velocity layer.  As it turns out, different notes respond very differently.  So this time, I focused on the timbre, trying to get the same amount of harmonics for each note in a layer.  I used the version1 samples for the second octave (where I had a harder time getting consistent timbres).
- The top velocity layer here is the 4th (2nd highest) layer in the original.  When playinb V1, I didn't find its top layer musically useful.
- V1 is stretched dynamically so that low velocity notes are quieter than the default.  This was needed to get the top velocity layers to sound loud enough (since the peaks are very high, whough without a lot of pitched content.)  With the new sample set, this didn't seem necessary so I didn't bother.
- I left out the three inner pads (C#6, D#6, and F6) which weren't musically very useful.

## How-to

Click the green "Clone or download" button above, and choose "Download ZIP". Unpack the .zip
file into a folder of your choice, and load the result into your sample player.  I use Sforzando,
which supports FLAC.

## About the instrument

This is a sampling of a steel drum hand-made in Trinidad and sold by Hopetown Music of Long
Beach CA, around 2005.  (See photo & PDF.)  The samples were recorded in September 2021.

Samples were recorded in mid-side stereo using an AT4033a as the mid mic and a Studio Projects
B3 as the side mic.  I am not a percussionist let alone a steel drum player, so
the dynamics are less even than I would like.  I hope to re-record the samples (I'd say
50% chance of this happening) so stay tuned.

## Controls

Use the Mod wheel (CC1) to control stereo depth.  With the mod wheel in the center (50%),
the stereo depth is 100% (normal.)  Pull the wheel all the way down to get pure mono, or push above
50% to get an extra wide image, or anything in between.  When you load the sampleset,
the depth will be 100% even if the mod wheel is not at zero, but if you move the mod
wheel, the depth will change accordingly.

Enjoy!
